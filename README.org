** Usage

#+begin_src zig
const obj = @import("zig-obj")

const model = try obj.parseObj("/path/to/model.obj");
const material = try obj.parseMtl("/path/to/material.mtl");
#+end_src

** Building

Build a static library by running:

#+begin_src bash
zig build
#+end_src

** Running tests

Tests are being ran automatically each day using the nightly Zig build.

Run the test suite manually with:

#+begin_src bash
zig build test
#+end_src
