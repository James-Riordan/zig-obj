* zig-obj
[[https://github.com/chip2n/zig-obj/workflows/build/badge.svg]]

Parse ~.obj~ and ~.mtl~ files with Zig.

Currently only have partial support for each file format (the things I've needed
for Blender exports so far while doing gamedev). If something is missing, feel
free to open an issue and/or pull request.
